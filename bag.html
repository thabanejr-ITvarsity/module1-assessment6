            <p>Packing a perfectly appointed workbag is walking on a razor's edge. You need to be prepared but unencumbered. You need items that function. You need items that are convenient. You need stuff but you don't want mass.<p>
            <p>your keys can't do anything for you when you spill lunch on your new white shirt. Your wallet and phone can't protect you from surprise showers. When you leave your house, make sure you have everything youâ€™ll need for the day. Make the journey to work less miserable with these things to carry, organize, and optimize your day.</p>
