            <p>A filing cabinet (or sometimes file cabinet in American English) is a piece of office furniture usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple context, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. </p>
            <p>Having all the necessary files and folders stored in a single place can reduce loss of company information or damage to the filing cabinetâ€™s contents. Companies can also increase security to the files and folders that are stored in the filing cabinet by getting fire-proof units. </p>
